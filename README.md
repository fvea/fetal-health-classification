# Fetal Health Classification

Worked on a predictive models with the highest accuracy of 94% that classifies fetal health in order to prevent child and maternal mortality using Cardiotocograms (CTGs) data.

## Dataset
The dataset is available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/fetal-health-classification) and contains 2126 records of features extracted from Cardiotocogram exams, which were then classified by three expert obstetricians into 3 classes:
- Normal
- Suspect
- Pathological

## Methodology
For model training, different models from ```scikit-learn``` were used to model the CTGs data to classify fetal health. The model includes Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbors, Support Vector Machine, and Gaussian Naive-Bayes models. The methodology of the project includes:
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Data preprocessing
- Preliminary Modeling
- Model Improvement (Grid Search)

## Preview
